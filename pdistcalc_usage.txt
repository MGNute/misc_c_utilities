Usage for P-Distance Calculator:

    ./pd [options]
       
Common options:
    
    -max        outputs the maximum p-distance instead of the average
                pairwise.
            
    -aln        path to FASTA file containing the alignment. If this is
                not given, alignment sequences are assumed to come via
                stdin. If the alignment comes via stdin, nothing else 
                can be given via stdin. 
            
    -sub        path to file containing a subset of sequences to be
                used for the computation. File should be one sequence
                name per line. Specified sequences that are not 
                actually in the fasta are ignored.
            
    -n_sub      number of sequences in the subset list. If omitted, 
                calculates p-dist on the whole file.
    
    -verbose    if given, program prints several intermediate values to
                stdout
    
    -debug      Goes into debug mode, prints some stuff and then exits
            
    -h          Prints this help description and then terminates
